This is the code used in the the St. Olaf CURI project "Control and Optimization of Active Transport Processes" during the summer of 2025. The goal of this project was to research how
active matter can be modeled as persistent random walks on discrete lattices. This particular problem was concerned with finding the optimal persistence policy of a random walker in order to
reach a target in the shortest amount of steps possible. This was investigated for different sized square lattices with periodic boundary conditions. The main quantity to optimize for this problem 
was the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) which is a well known quantity in probability theory and has been studied in different contexts before. Two different formalizations of the persistence
probabilities were studied, the one studied in the Tejedor paper "Optimizing Persistent Random Searches" and one without constraint except the normalization of the probabilities.
